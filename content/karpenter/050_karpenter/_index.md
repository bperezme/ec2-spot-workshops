In this section we will setup Karpenter. Karpenter is an open-source autoscaling project built for Kubernetes. Karpenter is designed to provide the right compute resources to match your applicationâ€™s needs in seconds, instead of minutes by observing the aggregate resource requests of unschedulable pods and makes decisions to launch and terminate nodes to optimize the cluster cost.
